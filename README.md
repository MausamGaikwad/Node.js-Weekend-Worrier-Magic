## Weekend Worrier Web App
This simple web application, named "Weekend Worrier," is built using the Express.js framework and designed to provide a personalized message based on whether it's a weekday or a weekend. The application uses an EJS (Embedded JavaScript) template for rendering dynamic content.

## Project Structure
* index.ejs: EJS template file for rendering the HTML content with dynamic data.
* server.js: The main server file written in Node.js using Express.js. It calculates the current day and provides corresponding advice based on whether it's a weekday or a weekend.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

2. Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weekend-worrier.git

3. Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd weekend-worrier

4.Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install

5. Run the application:

bash
Copy code
node server.js

6. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the Weekend Worrier app.

## Usage
The application automatically determines whether it's a weekday or a weekend based on the current date. It then displays a personalized message with advice accordingly.

## Customization
Feel free to customize the messages in the server.js file based on your preferences. You can modify the advice given for weekdays and weekends to suit your needs.

``javascript
- let type = "It's a Weekday";
- let adv = "It's Time to Work Harder";

- if (date === 0 || date === 6) {
-    type = "It's a Weekend";
-   adv = "Enjoy the Weekend and Have Fun!";
- }`
